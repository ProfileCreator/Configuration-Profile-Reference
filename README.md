# Configuration-Profile-Reference

Apple's [Configuration Profile Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html) has no meaningful changelog to let administrators know what has changed between updates.

This is a markdown copy of the [Configuration Profile Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html) with commits for each document version of the page.

This repository is generated from a python scraping script using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to extract the html as objects to be able to reformat it to markdown.
