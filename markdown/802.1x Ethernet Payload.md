# 802.1x Ethernet Payload  

 [Configuration Profile Reference - 802.1x Ethernet Payload](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010206-CH1-SW425)  

The 802.1x Ethernet payload is designated by specifying one of the following as the `PayloadType` value:  


* `com.apple.firstactiveethernet.managed` [default]  

* `com.apple.firstethernet.managed`  

* `com.apple.secondactiveethernet.managed`  

* `com.apple.secondethernet.managed`  

* `com.apple.thirdactiveethernet.managed`  

* `com.apple.thirdethernet.managed`  

* `com.apple.globalethernet.managed`  
  

In addition to the settings common to all payloads, this payload defines the following keys:   

|Key|Type|Value|
|-|-|-|
|`Interface`|String|The `com.apple.globalethernet.managed` payload uses the value `AnyEthernet`. The values for the other payloads are derived from their name; for example the `com.apple.firstethernet.managed` value would be `FirstEthernet`.|
  

Payloads with “active” in their name apply to Ethernet interfaces that are working at the time of profile installation. If there is no active Ethernet interface working, the `com.apple.firstactiveethernet.managed` payload will configure the interface with the highest service order priority.  

Payloads without “active” in the name apply to Ethernet interfaces according to service order regardless of whether the interface is working or not.  

There is currently no support for a BSD level specifier.  

To specify an enterprise profile for a given 802.1x network, include the `EAPClientConfiguration` key in the payload, as described in [EAPClientConfiguration Dictionary](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010206-CH1-SW31).
