# AirPrint Payload  

 [Configuration Profile Reference - AirPrint Payload](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010206-CH1-SW39)  

The AirPrint payload adds AirPrint printers to the userâ€™s AirPrint printer list. This makes it easier to support environments where the printers and the devices are on different subnets. An AirPrint payload is designated by specifying `com.apple.airprint` as the `PayloadType` value.  

This payload is supported on iOS 7.0 and later and on macOS 10.10 and later.
